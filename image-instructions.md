# Game Images Setup Instructions

To complete your localization showcase, you need to add images for your VIP projects:

## Required Images:

1. **dragons-dogma-2.jpg** - Dragon's Dogma II screenshot or promotional image
2. **super-mario-party-jamboree.jpg** - Super Mario Party Jamboree screenshot or promotional image

## Image Specifications:

- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Dimensions**: 400x200px (or similar 2:1 aspect ratio)
- **Quality**: High resolution for crisp display
- **Content**: Game screenshots, promotional art, or official artwork

## Where to Find Images:

### Dragon's Dogma II:
- Official Capcom press kit
- Steam store page screenshots
- Official game website
- Gaming news sites (ensure proper usage rights)

### Super Mario Party Jamboree:
- Official Nintendo press kit
- Nintendo eShop screenshots
- Official Nintendo website
- Gaming news sites (ensure proper usage rights)

## How to Add Images:

1. Save the images in the `portfolio-website` folder
2. Name them exactly as specified above
3. The website will automatically display them

## Fallback:

If images aren't found, the website shows elegant placeholder icons with game names, so the section still looks professional.

## Copyright Note:

Ensure you have proper rights to use the images. For portfolio purposes, screenshots and promotional materials are typically acceptable under fair use, but verify based on your local laws and company policies.
